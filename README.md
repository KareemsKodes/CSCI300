# CSCI300
Repo for my CSCI 300 class

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was selecting an appropriate data structure to hold course information. Then I had to make sort and print the courses in the most efficient way using the data structure I chose. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The way I approached the problem was that I looked at different data structures, my ability to impliment them, and their strength and weeknesses. The vector data structure is easy to impliment, and I think it is best for simple applications. The Hash Table is good for accessing/searching, but had seems impossible to sort. The Binary Search tree is already sorted, and it is very fast to search through. Based on that analysis, I thought it was best to use a binary search tree.


How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One roadblock I encountered while going through this project was figuring out how to read through the CSV file. Lines might have different numbers of entries. I had to make sure that the program was able to read exactly the number of entries on each line, which I found difficult, and the resources available to me we not as helpful as I had hoped. I did a bit of trial and error and eventually found a solution and got my code working. All the other aspects of my code seem to have worked well on the first try thanks to previous implimentation of a binary search tree.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has helped me to understand the strength and weeknesses of different data structures. I have learned to impliment each of the data structures we went through in this course. I also learned how to approach a more complex project. I got a better understanding of planning and anaylsis of my code. 


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project has evolved the way that I write programs in that it helped me understand a coulpe of things when it comes to planning code. First, I learned different ways to analyze the resources code might use and the time code might take to run. Then, I learned that although I dont want to over plan, I want to make sure i cover all aspects that I can in my analysis so that I have the best overall plan. Third, I learned different ways of holding data and how to impliment them and their related functions. This will all be helpful in planning and writing future code.
